# equivariant-basis
$\mathbf{GL}(m) \times \mathbf{GL}(n)$-equivariant decomposition for linear maps $A \in \mathbf{Hom}(V, W)$ into Schur funcors, as well as the filtration of $K[\mathbf{Hom}(V, W)]$, the coordinate ring, into the associated graded algebra. We would like to potentially use this to help our understanding of equivariant layers in neural networks.
