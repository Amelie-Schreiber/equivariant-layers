# equivariant-basis
$\mathbf{GL}(m) \times \mathbf{GL}(n)$-equivariant filtration for linear maps $A \in \mathbf{Hom}(V, W)$ into Schur funcors, as well as the decomposition of $K[\mathbf{Hom}(V, W)]$, the coordinate ring. We would like to potentially use this to help our understanding of equivariant layers in neural networks.
